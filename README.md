HRRR
====
In order to evaluate the HRRR model, a python module called "pyhrrr" was developed to facilitate data processing, analysis and visualization of the model. For observational comparison, radar, sounding and ceilometer data from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program Southern Great Plains (SGP) site were filtered and then averaged into blocks matching the vertical grid structure HRRR uses. Cloud cover in the radar was compared with HRRR 1hr projections over a four-month period. The HRRR model output matched the general physics and bulk features of the ARM observations, but the HRRR model had trouble modeling low clouds and often the extent of clouds in general.
